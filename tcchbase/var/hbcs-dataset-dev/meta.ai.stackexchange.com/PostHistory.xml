It is true that AI can indeed be smarter than the creator at certain tasks (AlphaGo being better at Go than the programmers of AlphaGo, for instance). What I think this argument is really saying is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&quot;AI is just bits and bytes programmed by its creator. The creator would be able to *know* how the AI works, otherwise he would be unable to create it in the first place. Therefore, the creator can be said to be *superior* to that of its creation, since the creator can understand its creation.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That seems like a more logical premise. Sure, AlphaGo is better at Go than the programmers of AlphaGo, but AlphaGo's programmers actually knows how AlphaGo operates. This type of argument was made in the paper [Creativity, the Turing Test, and the (better) Lovelace Test](http://kryten.mm.rpi.edu/lovelace.pdf), which specifically argues that  AIs cannot be creative since programmers are able to figure out what their creations (AIs) are doing. Another paper [&quot;The Lovelace 2.0 Test of Artificial Creativity and Intelligence&quot;](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6142v3.pdf) saw this argument as so self-evidently true that it tried to create a weaker version of the Lovelace Test to identify and measure AI creativity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The programmers, basically, know how their program works. That doesn't mean the program is less intelligent than the programmers. Just that the programmers can understand why their programs behave the way they do, given enough time and patience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Either way, I would not support discouraging answers such as these, if only because this view does have support within the AI scholarly community. If you have experts who hold this view, then we should let this view be given exposure." />

(This effect occurs because people see a good question, but already with a certain number of votes, and think &quot;oh, I would have upvoted this, but it already has enough&quot;.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It's easy for us to affect this &quot;base level&quot; by encouraging high levels of upvoting now. We're setting the standards, and this really will have an effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (On MathOverflow, we were very active about this early on, specifically encouraging all the initial round of users to vote early and often. You can compare statistics, and see that the average vote total for a MathOverflow question is much higher than on any of the other SE 1.0 sites.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In case it's not obvious: the rationale for wanting this base level to be high is that it provides better positive feedback to good contributors.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Especially in the beginning, let us vote early, and vote often. More voting always helps. Downvotes, too, are good – we want to weed out the wheat from the chaff here, and get rid of poor questions and answers." />

Be sure to include a beginner's level explanation (and a more advance one too, if you're in the mood) .&#xD;&#xA; - Include a link to your answer by editing the **Index** below (for quick reference).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example in an answer someone introduces all open source or non open source libraries that can be used to implement Bee colony algorithm in C++, lisp, prolog, etc together with advantages and disadvantages of each API.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In another someone introduces APIs to implement SVM classifier in MathLab, C++, etc with its advantages and disadvantage.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do you think it can be a good fit for this site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://mathematica.stackexchange.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/18393/what-are-the-most-common-pitfalls-awaiting-new-users" />

Despite the creation of a Data Science site to cover this topic, the community made a sufficiently compelling case that there is a swath of **questions in the academic humanities arena** that are *not* covered by our current sites. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It was convincing enough to give this site another try, but if this site were to simply start reiterating the implementation/tools questions that are already covered elsewhere, this site will not likely make it out of private beta.

It seems that there is a high chance of closure, despite the stats supposedly being on our side.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, interest in AI is *not* going away. It hasn't gone away the last time an AI StackExchange was proposed and shut down. We still need to deal with the humanities aspect of this field...and to help try to &quot;demystify&quot; the field of artificial intelligence. Until we get a good answer to this problem of dealing with artificial intelligence in a unified manner, all that's going to happen is a *fourth* AI proposal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, technically, there are many sites that can handle AI questions. I mentioned about them in [this Area51 post](http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/a/23515/152111), and how a programmer could build an AI simply by cobbling together answers from multiple StackExchange sites. I also stated that the *de facto* solution to the AI problem is a very problematic one:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The AI programmer is stuck traveling from one site to another (though Google is helping out), asking questions on each individual site, to try and figure out how to accomplish his single goal. This AI programmer is a migratory beast, out to stitch together random answers on Stack Exchange into a coherent 'whole' that he can then use. ... Is it sensible for AI programmers to be *dependent* on 6 to 8 different sites, at any given time? Is it sensible for these 6 to 8 sites to *pander* to these AI programmers instead of answering other questions? Or is it better to instead consolidate AI-specific questions from these 6 to 8 different sites, onto a single site that is easy to browse and look up? Some overlap between the communities may be inevitable, but it's better than the current status quo.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This idea has been [resurrected by by kenorb recently](http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/a/25180/152111) very recently:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;If it fails, the backup is to have 20 different accounts and ask the AI questions across the different sites such as Stats.SE, CSTheory.SE, CogSci.SE, Philosophy.SE, Worldbuilding.SE, SO.SE, CS.SE, HSM.SE, Robotics.SE, GameDev.SE, with no real AI experts focused in one place.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have built [&quot;StackAI&quot;](http://stackai.herokuapp.com), a StackExchange aggregator of several AI-related StackExchange sites which I may plan on upgrading in the future to include other AI-related StackExchange sites (such as CogSci, Robotics, etc.). But I'm still dubious on whether this site would indeed be the best solution for our crisis. It's a good one-stop directory to help a migratory questioner know *where* they can ask their questions, but the process is still rather inefficient and we lack the consolidation that a standard AI site could provide for us...and, of course, I doubt that these other sites would even *appreciate* the influx of these migratory questioners.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there a better way to deal with the migratory AI questioner? Even if it is to just improve StackAI?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I get discouraged and cynical rather easily, so maybe I'm being overly pessimistic about this site. But I do care about helping out people, and will want to help them out, even if &quot;ai.stackexchange.com&quot; dies again." />

I have a blog [on which I mentioned the site a while back](https://fleexlab.blogspot.com/2016/08/ai-stack-exchange-site.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've been doing what I can to make sure this site survives, and that has required casting a few close votes. Hopefully I haven't come off as too much of a maniacal ruthless reviewer `:)`. When asked on meta, in comments, or in [chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/43371/artificial-intelligence) about why a question is closed, I always write up a helpful, respectful explanation. If I ever do something you think is less than ideal, please feel free to ask me about it! Like all humans (though perhaps not AIs!) I make the occasional mistake, and when I see that's happened, I make it right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have my own opinions and judgments, of course, but I would be happy to carry out as moderator pro tempore the consensus of the community, the mod team, and Stack Exchange. We're all in this together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's a pleasure building this community with everyone here. I look forward to continuing to the next stage of site growth with y'all!" />

Check also my [user CV profile][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My first AI program was a chat bot written over 18 years ago in Pascal with custom written assembler libraries in order to make my school mates believing that they are chatting on IRC with real people, while being on the computers without any internet connection, so other can play games on spare computers with the real network. This worked, for the first 15-30 minutes, later on they could find out that something was wrong or get bored. Second project was involved AI bots protecting IRC channels. I did some AI in games. Since then I am interested in practical applications of AI. This is my long term hobby and interest. Further projects required more sophisticated requirements. Currently I am working on integration AI with the financial algorithms and systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am good team player, so I am able to cooperate with other mods, I'm also available on daily basis. I hope to improve this site along with other mods and keep it away from chaos, spam and trolls, in order to provide high quality site. If I would not be selected, I hope people which I have nominated could have a chance, as I believe they have good intentions. Also they are not involved too much with other specific SE sites, which makes them dedicated to this one, making it as one unique site joining into existing network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5ea4c668-1364-11e6-91da-096d89bd2173.html#axzz4HXDwufht&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://stackoverflow.com/cv/kenorb" />

I'm pleased to accept it. I'm interested in helping this site help people better understand AI and the issues surrounding it, both through direct effort and community building. I've been clearing out review queues here as soon as I got access to them, and that's typically the first thing I check after my comment inbox. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm currently in Austin, Texas, and so would typically be online from to about noon to 2am UTC. I've been doing machine-learning related work for, depending on how you count it, about 8 years now, mostly as a student but now also as a data scientist. My research effort has mostly been in numerical optimization, machine reliability, and time series analysis, rounded out by my personal interests in psychology, economics, and philosophy. I've been interested in intelligence for as long as I can remember, and that grew to encompass artificial intelligence as soon as I was introduced to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To a large degree I 'grew up on the internet'; forum-posting has been a major hobby for over half of my life at this point. I've consistently had a reputation for being polite, calm, and open-minded; qualities that I hope would serve me well as a moderator." />

One of the recent one is planning to ['to deploy drone army'][1] worldwide which can expand our scope of understanding of artificial intelligence (e.g. imagine flying drones in the restaurant and delivering your food to your table after pressing a single button). Check also my [user CV profile][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My first AI program was a chat bot written over 18 years ago in Pascal with custom written assembler libraries in order to make my school mates believing that they are chatting on IRC with real people, while being on the computers without any internet connection, so other can play games on spare computers with the real network. This worked, for the first 15-30 minutes, later on they could find out that something was wrong or get bored. Second project was involved AI bots protecting IRC channels. I did some AI in games. Since then I am interested in practical applications of AI. This is my long term hobby and interest. Further projects required more sophisticated requirements. Currently I am working on integration AI with the financial algorithms and systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am good team player, so I am able to cooperate with other mods, I'm also available on daily basis (GMT/DST time).

I believe this site has unique opportunity to make a huge impact to global technology market driven by artificial intelligence and our everyday life in very near future by sharing advanced knowledge accessible for all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have been using SE for over 7 years, I am experienced across a variety of fields and I am familiar with moderation tools and I understand their purpose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am an experienced software engineer specialising in a variety of information technology stacks with over 18 years experience consulting across a range of sectors and multination companies. One of the recent one is planning to ['to deploy drone army'][1] worldwide which can expand our scope of understanding of artificial intelligence (e.g. imagine flying drones in the restaurant and delivering your food to your table after pressing a single button). Check also my [user CV profile][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My first AI program was a chat bot written over 18 years ago in Pascal with custom written assembler libraries in order to make my school mates believing that they are chatting on IRC with real people, while being on the computers without any internet connection, so other can play games on spare computers with the real network. This worked, for the first 15-30 minutes, later on they could find out that something was wrong or get bored. Second project was involved AI bots protecting IRC channels. I did some AI in games. Since then I am interested in practical applications of AI. This is my long term hobby and interest. Further projects required more sophisticated requirements.

I believe that this site has a unique opportunity to make a huge impact to global technology market driven by artificial intelligence and our everyday life in the very near future by sharing advanced knowledge accessible for all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have been using SE for over 7 years, I am experienced across a variety of fields and I am familiar with moderation tools and I understand their purpose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am an experienced software engineer specialising in a variety of information technology stacks with over 18 years experience consulting across a range of sectors and multination companies. One of the recent one is planning to ['to deploy drone army'][1] worldwide which can expand our scope of understanding of artificial intelligence (e.g. imagine flying drones in the restaurant and delivering your food to your table after pressing a single button). Check also my [user CV profile][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My first AI program was a chat bot written over 18 years ago in Pascal with custom written assembler libraries in order to make my school mates believing that they are chatting on IRC with real people, while being on the computers without any internet connection, so other can play games on spare computers with the real network. This worked, for the first 15-30 minutes, later on they could find out that something was wrong or get bored. Second project was involved AI bots protecting IRC channels. I did some AI in games. Since then I am interested in practical applications of AI. This is my long term hobby and interest. Further projects required more sophisticated requirements. Currently I am working on integration AI with the financial algorithms and systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am good team player, so I am able to cooperate with other mods, I'm also available on daily basis (GMT/DST time). I hope we can improve this site by keeping it away from chaos, spam and trolls, to provide high quality site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5ea4c668-1364-11e6-91da-096d89bd2173.html#axzz4HXDwufht&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://stackoverflow.com/cv/kenorb" />

I think there are questions open... I mean without *current* answer, to say it coarsely. I can imagine, that some answers will turn out to be out-of-date or be outperformed many times. It is possible that in one month or one year we get a very different answer, because **(a)** Some people are researching actively and discovered something amazing, or **(b)** New users come to the site (and knew of a better answer).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**2.** AI.SX is definitely different from other sites in stackexchage, because the questions are not like *quickies*. It is not like *I need to solve this urgent issue now, how do I do it?*. Many questions have different answers, which often complement themselves. Also, from the comments on an answer (or question), it can be edited to include new points and will be better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**3.** The former point is much more noticeable, since this site is about *science* and not *technology*. The topic about specific algorithms or techniques has been discussed here on several meta questions. A side-effect is that the questions tend to be (in my opinion) broader. I personally think that is OK, and wish for a certain discussion rather than **the** answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Seeing all that, I think that many questions could be left open for... Well, like forever.

New developments (e.g. new language features) allow new and better solutions to problems. That's yet another reason why questions should allow new answers even after one is accepted.

Fortunately, we have something else to measure answer usefulness:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Votes.** Posts accept votes forever (in most cases), and new answers (among other events) push the question back onto the site front page so it can be examined anew.
